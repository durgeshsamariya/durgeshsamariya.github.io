Selected Open-Source Projects
-----------------------------
Here is the list of my selected open-source projects and code repo.

## 1. [MLGenerator](https://github.com/durgeshsamariya/MLgenerator)

A web-app to generate code for different machine learning task. 

MLGenerator is a simple web based tool to generate starter template code for different machine learning tasks, build using streamlit. You can build custom starter code for different machine learning algorithms/tasks such as Regression, Classification, Clustering and Anomaly(Outlier) detection. MLGenerator uses different widely used Python libraries for different tasks such as Scikit-Learn for Classification, PyOD for anomaly detection etc.

It is developed in my free time while learning and main motivation is to help machine learning beginers with starter code.
